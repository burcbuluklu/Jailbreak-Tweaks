Respring Logo Tweak Requests from r/jailbreak (Tested on iPhone 6, iOS 9.3.3)
Edit on 2021: Since Apple disabled respring logos after iOS 10, these tweaks are dead. 
If you want to use with iOS below version 10 or with [[MakeRespringsGreatAgain]], packages are available in Modmyi Archive Repo in Cydia.
